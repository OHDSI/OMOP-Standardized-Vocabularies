# OMOP-Standardized-Vocabularies
This repository was used before **Aug 2018** and now only contains historical Release Notes of the Standardized Vocabularies. 


Note: It does **NOT** contain the actual Releases. You can find it at https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/releases

It also does **NOT** contain the scripts and programs to generate the Standard Vocabularies. Those are at https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0

If you have questions, problems, or found bugs please create an issue in the repository above.
