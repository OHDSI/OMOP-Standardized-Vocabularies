# OMOP-Standardized-Vocabularies
This repository contains the Release Notes of the Standardized Vocabularies. 

Note: It does *not* contain the actual Release. You can find that at http://www.athena.ohdsi.org.

It also does not contain the scripts and programs to generate the Standard Vocabularies. Those are at https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0.
