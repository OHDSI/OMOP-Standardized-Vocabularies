Release 17-Jul-2015
Refresh: RxNorm, ATC, VA Class, NDFRT, NDC, SPL

All these vocabularies were updated to the latest version.
Refactored: MeSH

All MeSH are incorporated that represent Concepts of the Condition, Procedure, Drug and Measurement domains and have a mapping to CPT4, RxNorm, SNOMED and LOINC Concepts. Note: MeSH is very large, and in contrast to other databases we load only those codes that we can map to Standard Concepts.

Note that the vocabulary is now called "MeSH" (not "Mesh" or "MESH")

This repository contains the Release Notes of the Standardized Vocabularies.

Note: It does not contain the actual Release. You can find that at the Athena website.

It also does not contain the scripts and programs to generate the Standard Vocabularies. Those are at the Github repository.
