## Added

### ICDO3 vocabulary

It contains 

#### original ICDO3 topography and morphology codes

linked to their SNOMED equivalents throught "ICDO - SNOMED" relationship

#### artificially built combination concepts like: 

concept_code = '8000/0-C00', concept_name = 'Neoplasm, benign of Lip structure', that is a combination of '8000/0' "Neoplasm, benign" and 'C00' "Lip"
Such a concepts have 

  - relationships to ICDO3
      "Has Topography ICDO" --link to topography ('C00')
      "Has Histology ICDO" -- link to Histology ('8000/0')

  - relationships to SNOMED

    1) if the concept has exact SNOMED equivalent
      "Maps to" , for example our '8000/0-C00' 'Neoplasm, benign of Lip structure' 'Maps to' SNOMED 92185002 Benign neoplasm of lip

    2) if it doesn't have SNOMED equivalent, for example, '8140/3-C61.9' "Adenocarcinoma of Prostate gland",
      it has the following relationships:
      "Is a" SNOMED 93974005 Primary malignant neoplasm of prostate (Hierarchical SNOMED parent)
       "Has finding site" SNOMED 279689003 Prostatic gland structure
      "Has asso morph" SNOMED 35917007 Adenocarcinoma
