Release 8-Jun-2015

Addition: Vocabulary CIEL and mappings
All added CIEL Concepts are non-Standard (source). Mapping to SNOMED, LOINC, CPT4 and RxNorm were added. The vocabulary is ready to be used for OpenMRS data conversion OMOP CDM.

Addition: DM+D Drug Concepts to SNOMED
DM+D was added to the SNOMED vocabulary, which is now a union of SNOMED International, SNOMED UK and DM+D (SNOMED UK Drug Extension). No relationships were added yet. The next release will contain relationships to RxNorm, ATC and the newly added BNF Drug Class vocabulary.

Addition: LOINC mapping to SNOMED and CPT4
Mapping of LOINC Concepts to SNOMED was added. In addition, mapping from LOINC Concepts to CPT4 was added. Note: Both mappings are work in progress and cover only a small percentage of LOINC Concepts.

Refresh: Vocabulary GPI and mappings
The GPI Drug Vocabulary was updated to the latest release 15.2.1.002, including mappings to RxNorm. Note: Not all GPI Concepts have valid concept_name entries. The ones that don't contain a single space character.

Refresh: Vocabulary OPCS4 and relationships
OPCS4 concepts and mappings to SNOMED were refreshed, and the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table updated accordingly

Bug fix: NDC duplicate mapping removed
NDC codes mapped to Quantified Clinical Drug or Quantified Branded Drug are remapped to their non-quantified equivalents. The bug did not deprecate existing such mappings that were overwritten by a refresh. As a result, about 2,800 NDC codes had mappings to two different RxNorm Concepts.
